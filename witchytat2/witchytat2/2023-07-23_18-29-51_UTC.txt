I flew across the country for one weekend to sit in @witchytat2 chair for a brutal 28 hours… and the end result was more than I could’ve ever dreamed of. 2 days back to back, pulling all nighters was one of the hardest things mentally and physically I have ever done, but I did it, I didn’t tap, and most importantly she did it and didn’t tap either. I can’t thank her enough for sticking this out with me, putting such a beautiful piece of her artwork on me, and allowing me to carry her art forever. GIVE YOUR ARTIST CREATIVE FREEDOM!
