This tattoo was crazy!!!! My client/friend came down from Georgia for the weekend and we ended up tattooing 28 hours in 2 days. This piece was only day one. It took a lot of patience, and a lot of pain from both of us! I m so proud of her sitting through the whole tattoo! She is a trooper for putting up with me for 28hrs straight haha. A lot of initial d and Japanese inspo in this piece! Canâ€™t wait to do more of this style and also Canâ€™t wait to finish this sleeve :) 
Scroll for more pics during the tattoo. 
Thanks @her_s14_ for sitting through the white highlights both days ðŸ˜‚
