I Love doing little kitten tattoos ðŸ¥¹

There's a reason people believe cats have nine lives. It's because cats represent resilience, and a lot of people choose to get a cat tattoo â€” most notably their paws â€” because of what it means for life after death and having luck in life

Reasons to choose a cat tattoo are always personal but can include a desire to seek out spiritual elements in your life, a belief in self-reliance, a show of feminine strength, an obstacle overcome, bouncing back from a bad situation and carrying luck with you wherever your adventures take you. Or simply because we love our black cats so much!! 

Who wants a cat tattoo?
