Here is a moth botanical tattoo I did and some black berries âœ¨ðŸ¦‡ðŸ–¤

Some people choose to get moth tattoos because they represent transformation and change. Others see them as symbols of hope and new beginnings. And still others see them as reminders that even in the darkest times, we can find our way back to the light. Moths are also associated with death. 

Luna moth tattoos represent a metamorphosis in someoneâ€™s life, and you may want to receive a luna moth tattoo if you are going through big changes in your life, especially positive changes.

The symbol of the blackberry is rich in meaning and symbolism, making it perfect for a tattoo design or piece of body art.

In Greek mythology, the nymph Daphne was transformed into a Blackberry bush after she rejected Apolloâ€™s advances. The god then took his revenge by creating a wood in her image that bears the fruit she was turned into. 

There are also legends that say when Eve plucked the apple from the tree, she was actually plucking a Blackberry.

Celtic culture shares a number of similar themes with Greek mythology due to their common ancestry. The Celts also have stories that link berries to immortality and reincarnation. It was believed that consuming seven types of berries would allow people to live forever and that the druids (Celtic priests) believed in reincarnation.

I love how this piece came out and how it flows on the body! Definitely one of my top 10 favorites <33
