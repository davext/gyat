Will you rot with me? ðŸ¦‡ðŸ–¤âœ¨

In many cultures around the world, crows are a dark omen. They are associated with bad news and even death, and people are often aware of these grim meanings when they get inked with the ominous bird. Crows are exquisite, sharp-looking, and mystical creatures. Crows are also known to turn on each other and are very much linked to the macabre, especially since artwork depicts them as pecking out human eyes.

In Greek mythology, a crow was used to deliver bad news to Athena, who changed the crowâ€™s feathers to black from white, and the bird was henceforth forbidden to enter Acropolis. 

Crows are very intelligent. They have a unique language, and their cawing sounds represent different meanings. 

The noose is a powerful symbol no matter how you look at it and this is why it has become a well known tattoo. The noose can sometimes mean impending death. This is a popular version of the tattoo for people who are either sick or otherwise know that they are going to die. The hangmanâ€™s knot can also represent the inevitability of death. This is a more widely used version of the noose tattoo since anyone can get it and use it as motivation. Looking at the noose can remind them to live each day to the fullest since life ends for everyone. This is still a pretty dark message, but itâ€™s one of the nicer noose tattoo meanings. some people use the noose tattoo to represent love. For example, a common noose tattoo has two people inside of the noose to signify that they will be together until death.
