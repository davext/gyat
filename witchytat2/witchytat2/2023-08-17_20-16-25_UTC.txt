Psalm 118:6 🙏🏼✨👼

Finding their origin within the Roman Catholic Church, both the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary share intrinsic links within religious imagery. the Sacred Heart is a demonstration of Christs transformative power of divine love, whilst the wounds or crown of thorns around the heart allude to Jesus’ death.

Veni, vidi, vici is a Latin phrase meaning 'I came, I saw, I conquered'. It was first said by Julius Caesar after winning a battle in Asia Minor (now Turkey).

Angel wings typically represent protection, guidance, and love.

Saint Michael is an archangel, a spiritual warrior in the battle of good versus evil. He is considered a champion of justice, a healer of the sick, and the guardian of the Church. In art Saint Michael is depicted with a sword, a banner, or scales, and is often shown vanquishing Satan in the form of a dragon.
