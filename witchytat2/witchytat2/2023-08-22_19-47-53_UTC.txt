For the past 1.5- 2 years tattooing has been my whole life! 
As a tattoo artist, you get to enjoy a creative career that centers around artwork you love. But, thereâ€™s lots of extra work and sacrifices that goes into tattooing full time. 
So grateful for every day I get to do this job and every client I get to tattoo! Thank you for your continued support <333
