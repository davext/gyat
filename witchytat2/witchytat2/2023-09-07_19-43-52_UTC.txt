Baba Yaga's Hut, also called the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga, is a powerful artifact and the home of the infamous witch Baba Yaga.

What does Baba Yaga mean in Russian? "Baba" typically means "grandmother" in Slavic Languages, but can also mean "sorceress", "witch", or "fortune teller" depending on language and dialect. "Yaga" can refer to "serpent", "wood nymph", or "evil woman"

while Baba flies across the landscape in her giant pestle and mortar, and though she may seem scary, she might tell your fortune, in exchange for a year of your life, or then again she might just eat you.
