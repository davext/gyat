Skull tattoos are an extremely popular form of symbolism seen in both culture and tattoos. A skull tattoo can symbolize death, afterlife, and rebellion while for others it can symbolize a celebration of life. 
Thereâ€™s a deeper meaning to skull tattoo designs than most people realize. Skull designs are more than just a symbol of death and the afterlife. In fact, a skull tattoo design symbolizes the fragility of life, and the need to live it to the fullest. It reminds us to enjoy the time we have on this earth and to appreciate all of the good things that life has to offer. 
In many ancient spiritual traditions, a dog stands guard on the other side. A dog skull tattoo may symbolize the spiritual transition between life and death. Being a common symbol of loyalty, dogs can also represent your devotion to someone on the other side.
